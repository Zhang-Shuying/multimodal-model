Data

You can download the data in the supporting information of the manuscript “Multimodal Model to Predict Tissue-to-Blood Partition Coefficients of Chemicals in Mammals and Fish”



Prediction

The trained model is stored in 'muti-pub1.h5', the applicability domain method is stored in 'AppDomain.py', and the code in 'multimodal.py' can be used to carry out model computations, perform SHAP analysis, and applicability domain characterization.
